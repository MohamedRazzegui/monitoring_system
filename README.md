# Vocal Chatbot Monitoring System

## Description
This web app monitors vocal chatbot audio quality and evaluates text data.

## Context
The project was an attempt to explore the future of vocal chatbots by the time they get released in the market to be used freely.

## Checkpoint
We prepared the base ground for future researchers by exploring the fields of evaluation in a vocal chatbot and proposing evaluation methods.
1. Audio Quality Evaluation
2. Transcription Evaluation
3. Text Evaluation

## Challenges
1. Transcription Evaluation can't be done in real-time. Which is why we conducted and experiment to see the correlation between our way of audio quality evaluation and trasncription evaluation. The biggest challenge was the lack of large data.
2. The link between audio quality evaluation and text evaluation hasn't been set yet due to the field's complexity.

## Requirements (Input)
Seperate:
1. Conversatioin audio
2. Relative textual conversation.
